# rc-shell
Hello. :) This is where I put my rc related files, usually scripts that I think are pretty good.
Most things in here are WIP!

[[ rc ]](https://github.com/rakitzis/rc)

## scripts
* `cmpd` (Can be improved)
mpd "client" using mpc
* `gg` (WIP)
"git helper". I'm new to git, I made this so that I also can learn more about it.

## inputrc
This one is interesting.  
I didn't know that with inputrc, a lot of stuff that you can do on bash can also be done in rc.  
And some of rc's annoying stuff (e.g. you can't use ~ as /home/user/) can be minimized.  
It's a simple thing, but cool nonetheless.

## blog post
I don't really have any reason to use rc.  
Well it is fast, but the speed difference between shells are almost unnoticable. Do I like the syntax? it's fine, I'm still used to bash scripting.  

So why do I use it?  
It's mostly because it's fun to learn new stuff. Plan9 is an interesting project, so I'd like to try out some of its programs.  
Also, I fell for the "minimalism" meme.

I put this up because not a lot of people use rc, and it can be hard to learn scripting when there's not a lot of examples.
I'm still pretty new, but I hope this could be useful. :)
